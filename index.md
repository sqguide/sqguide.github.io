## Foreword
This is by no means an exhaustive Squad guide, merely a compendium of general game sense tips directed to an inexperienced Squad infantry player wanting to improve. I tried to keep it as brief and general as possible (I seem to have failed). Most of the information on here was gathered through my personal experience and close observation of some good Squad players over the years. For the experienced players choosing to read through this, I hope some of the arguments and statements in here make you reflect about the game; I would love to hear about the different aspects of the guide you agree/disagree with, and if you persuade me I will definitely update the information into the guide. 

My **personal opinions** are peppered all over the document, I am not telling you that this is the only way to play the game. The tips and arguments presented in this guide are what has worked for me and other players I have played with, and it could be possible that they don’t work for you. As per the OWI Code of Conduct, “there is no wrong way to play the game, there are only effective and ineffective tactics”, therefore take this guide as a suggestion!

Special thanks to Ol’ Jim (for helping provide and create clips) and various other members of the Squad community (notably Drizzle and Vex) for providing insights and second opinions on the contents of this document. 

Enjoy!

## The Player
### Tempo & Momentum
**Tempo is** a term I learned back when I played Hearthstone and it has stuck in my head since then. In simple terms, it describes which way the momentum of the round is going, and the control the player/squad/team has over the round. When you enter a round of Squad, you are constantly and subconsciously using tempo albeit some players better than others. Your goal as a game-aware infantry player is to always keep the tempo on the side of your squad, and your team in order to win.
