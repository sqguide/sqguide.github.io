## Foreword
This is by no means an exhaustive Squad guide, merely a compendium of general game sense tips directed to an inexperienced Squad infantry player wanting to improve. I tried to keep it as brief and general as possible (I seem to have failed). Most of the information on here was gathered through my personal experience and close observation of some good Squad players over the years. For the experienced players choosing to read through this, I hope some of the arguments and statements in here make you reflect about the game; I would love to hear about the different aspects of the guide you agree/disagree with, and if you persuade me I will definitely update the information into the guide. 

My **personal opinions** are peppered all over the document, I am not telling you that this is the only way to play the game. The tips and arguments presented in this guide are what has worked for me and other players I have played with, and it could be possible that they don’t work for you. As per the OWI Code of Conduct, “there is no wrong way to play the game, there are only effective and ineffective tactics”, therefore take this guide as a suggestion!

Special thanks to Ol’ Jim (for helping provide and create clips) and various other members of the Squad community (notably Drizzle and Vex) for providing insights and second opinions on the contents of this document. 

Enjoy!

### Settings
**FOV:** For squad, I have found lower FOV (90-95) works best to have a bigger image of long-range targets. I use 90 FOV.

**Sensitivity:** Pretty standard concept for all FPS games, I reccomend to have a glance at [Juho's Guide for Accurate Shooting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CeQZ4v-V9R8sZ7NdtiMf17x7_IM3kr_C28bkmuMvZLc/edit) and generic FPS sensitivity videos. 

**Graphic settings:** Although a lot about graphic settings are personal preference, I have found the following settings to give me the best results in-game (as of v3.0). These are ethical settings and I recommend them to anyone with enough decency not to use .ini tweaks. I found it easier to see through foliage on epic foliage compared to low. Muzzle flashes are easier to spot on epic particles when compared to low particles. Upping these settings seemed to have minimal effect on my FPS. Some people argue that high shadows + contact shadows off is better than low shadows but I prefer low shadows as they seem to impact my FPS less when shooting.

Additionally, look up your monitor on google for some calibration settings in order to have the best colours (can increase vibrance and sharpness through the monitor this way if you wish). 

**Binds:** I use all the default binds. A bind I would recommend adding is the SL/FTL order binds so that you can mark things whilst shooting without having to open the radial menu. You can do this in settings>controls>voice/command>place order. `You want to avoid using the attack order (sword marker) as your character raises his hand above his head and this can give your position away in urban areas / when hiding in foliage.`

**Player icons**: Again, personal preference but I heavily advise against using the “Toggle viewing roles as player icons” to keep your squad mates as arrows on the map. If you want to know their kit, you can hover over their names; usually it is not urgent to know their kit (exception can be a crewman in a vehicle). The main benefit of keeping your squad mates as arrows on the map is that you can see which direction they are looking. This in turn lets you know which direction you should look if they need help and you are far away or a different angle you can watch to support them. You cannot do this with “Toggle viewing roles as player icons” enabled. This setting is well hidden and can be toggled through the map screen while in a round of squad. You will not always be spoon-fed information by accurate enemy markers.

In the image below when I see the arrow of the downed player (looking north) near Nahrain combined with the helmet marker to the north-east, I can assume that they got downed while fighting a player to his north-east. Consequently, this gives me an idea of where to look first when I am spawning in to go assist them. Obviously, this isn’t the case 100% of the time as sometimes they could be looking in a random direction from being inexperienced or even be looking straight in the air. However, while having player arrows, you can still see their kits with an added bonus of knowing where the direction they are looking. If you use player role icons, you can not see the direction they are looking.

**Filters:** NVIDIA Freestyle filters are blocked by Squad and if you are like me, you don’t feel like downgrading your drivers to be able to use NVIDIA filters. The only correction I make to the colors above my monitor color settings is using the NVIDIA control panel digital vibrance to make colors pop more. (NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL>ADJUST DESKTOP COLOR SETTINGS>DIGITAL VIBRANCE

A lot of people enjoy playing with a bit more all-channel gamma (can be done in this same section of the NVIDIA control panel). 

### Kits
Below are some quick notes on the different infantry kits you could be playing in a round of squad.

**Medic**
The main role of the medic is to revive and provide stamina to teammates. As a medic, you should be the last one in your squad to die. 

Medics should be sticking behind the squad and playing for trades. This means when their squad mate dies from close by, they should try to kill the enemy that killed the squad mate to get the revive. 

If your teammates are good, they will die in good spots. You can revive them without even having to peek or throw smokes. Most bad medics are very reluctant and scared to go for revives; try to be more ambitious as a medic, especially when blessed with the opportunity of playing 2 medics in one squad.

The medic should constantly be moving to revive teammates and nothing else while there are dead people (avoid solo pushes and running in first). 

Reviving other medics is the top priority as they can help you get the other revives or help you out when you die. 

A medic can stick to key players such as the squad leader, optic player, machine gunners to instantly revive them when they die. This is coined being a  “pocket medic”.

When your friendlies get hit and start bleeding, bandage them so that they preserve their bandage. Why? You bandage way faster than they do, and they will conserve their bandage to revive you if you die for some reason. 

The medic should usually fully heal the players they revive. If you do not fully heal the player, they will be in a dead-dead state and lose a ticket when they die. Most of the time, “sticking the heal” is a better option than pulling your gun out.

When reviving, the medic should take command of the situation. They are alive so he knows what is going on. Tell the person you are reviving where to go to avoid getting sent to the spawn screen, and where to look (most likely area the enemies are going to come from). If someone is impossible to revive, promptly tell them that you will not go for them and that they should give up. 

When reviving people or healing them, do not stand too close to them. You can stretch the distance you are healing/reviving pretty far and it will give them the freedom to move (if you are too close you will collide with their ADS).

Dragging can be good to move a friendly around a corner or through a close doorway. You can also drag someone off a high area into cover / cause them to start rolling off a slope. Avoid dragging long distances as it is usually just quicker and less risky to revive in the open than spending two times more time dragging.

Try to avoid proning/sitting still while reviving so that you can cancel the revive and run away faster. Exception to this is if you are hiding behind a small object like a half wall or a window.
