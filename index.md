## Foreword
This is by no means an exhaustive Squad guide, merely a compendium of general game sense tips directed to an inexperienced Squad infantry player wanting to improve. I tried to keep it as brief and general as possible (I seem to have failed). Most of the information on here was gathered through my personal experience and close observation of some good Squad players over the years. For the experienced players choosing to read through this, I hope some of the arguments and statements in here make you reflect about the game; I would love to hear about the different aspects of the guide you agree/disagree with, and if you persuade me I will definitely update the information into the guide. 

My **personal opinions** are peppered all over the document, I am not telling you that this is the only way to play the game. The tips and arguments presented in this guide are what has worked for me and other players I have played with, and it could be possible that they don’t work for you. As per the OWI Code of Conduct, “there is no wrong way to play the game, there are only effective and ineffective tactics”, therefore take this guide as a suggestion!

Special thanks to Ol’ Jim (for helping provide and create clips) and various other members of the Squad community (notably Drizzle and Vex) for providing insights and second opinions on the contents of this document. 

Enjoy!

### Settings
**FOV:** For squad, I have found lower FOV (90-95) works best to have a bigger image of long-range targets. I use 90 FOV.

**Sensitivity:** Pretty standard concept for all FPS games, I reccomend to have a glance at [Juho's Guide for Accurate Shooting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CeQZ4v-V9R8sZ7NdtiMf17x7_IM3kr_C28bkmuMvZLc/edit) and generic FPS sensitivity videos. 

**Graphic settings:** Although a lot about graphic settings are personal preference, I have found the following settings to give me the best results in-game (as of v3.0). These are ethical settings and I recommend them to anyone with enough decency not to use .ini tweaks. I found it easier to see through foliage on epic foliage compared to low. Muzzle flashes are easier to spot on epic particles when compared to low particles. Upping these settings seemed to have minimal effect on my FPS. Some people argue that high shadows + contact shadows off is better than low shadows but I prefer low shadows as they seem to impact my FPS less when shooting.

Additionally, look up your monitor on Google for some calibration settings in order to have the best colours (can increase vibrance and sharpness through the monitor this way if you wish). 

**Binds:** I use all the default binds. A bind I would recommend adding is the SL/FTL order binds so that you can mark things whilst shooting without having to open the radial menu. You can do this in settings>controls>voice/command>place order. `You want to avoid using the attack order (sword marker) as your character raises his hand above his head and this can give your position away in urban areas / when hiding in foliage.`

**Player icons**: Again, personal preference but I heavily advise against using the “Toggle viewing roles as player icons” to keep your squad mates as arrows on the map. If you want to know their kit, you can hover over their names; usually it is not urgent to know their kit (exception can be a crewman in a vehicle). The main benefit of keeping your squad mates as arrows on the map is that you can see which direction they are looking. This in turn lets you know which direction you should look if they need help and you are far away or a different angle you can watch to support them. You cannot do this with “Toggle viewing roles as player icons” enabled. This setting is well hidden and can be toggled through the map screen while in a round of squad. You will not always be spoon-fed information by accurate enemy markers. 
![](/docs/settings4.PNG)
In the image below when I see the arrow of the downed player (looking north) near Nahrain combined with the helmet marker to the north-east, I can assume that they got downed while fighting a player to his north-east. Consequently, this gives me an idea of where to look first when I am spawning in to go assist them. Obviously, this isn’t the case 100% of the time as sometimes they could be looking in a random direction from being inexperienced or even be looking straight in the air. However, while having player arrows, you can still see their kits with an added bonus of knowing where the direction they are looking. If you use player role icons, you can not see the direction they are looking.

**Filters:** NVIDIA Freestyle filters are blocked by Squad and if you are like me, you don’t feel like downgrading your drivers to be able to use NVIDIA filters. The only correction I make to the colors above my monitor color settings is using the NVIDIA control panel digital vibrance to make colors pop more. (NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL>ADJUST DESKTOP COLOR SETTINGS>DIGITAL VIBRANCE

A lot of people enjoy playing with a bit more all-channel gamma (can be done in this same section of the NVIDIA control panel). 

### Kits
Below are some quick notes on the different infantry kits you could be playing in a round of squad.

**Medic**

The main role of the medic is to revive and provide stamina to teammates. As a medic, you should be the last one in your squad to die. 

Medics should be sticking behind the squad and playing for trades. This means when their squad mate dies from close by, they should try to kill the enemy that killed the squad mate to get the revive. 

If your teammates are good, they will die in good spots. You can revive them without even having to peek or throw smokes. Most bad medics are very reluctant and scared to go for revives; try to be more ambitious as a medic, especially when blessed with the opportunity of playing 2 medics in one squad.

The medic should constantly be moving to revive teammates and nothing else while there are dead people (avoid solo pushes and running in first). 

Reviving other medics is the top priority as they can help you get the other revives or help you out when you die. 

A medic can stick to key players such as the squad leader, optic player, machine gunners to instantly revive them when they die. This is coined being a  “pocket medic”.

When your friendlies get hit and start bleeding, bandage them so that they preserve their bandage. Why? You bandage way faster than they do, and they will conserve their bandage to revive you if you die for some reason. 

The medic should usually fully heal the players they revive. If you do not fully heal the player, they will be in a dead-dead state and lose a ticket when they die. Most of the time, “sticking the heal” is a better option than pulling your gun out.

When reviving, the medic should take command of the situation. They are alive so he knows what is going on. Tell the person you are reviving where to go to avoid getting sent to the spawn screen, and where to look (most likely area the enemies are going to come from). If someone is impossible to revive, promptly tell them that you will not go for them and that they should give up. 

When reviving people or healing them, do not stand too close to them. You can stretch the distance you are healing/reviving pretty far and it will give them the freedom to move (if you are too close you will collide with their ADS). 
![](/docs/kits1.PNG)

Dragging can be good to move a friendly around a corner or through a close doorway. You can also drag someone off a high area into cover / cause them to start rolling off a slope. Avoid dragging long distances as it is usually just quicker and less risky to revive in the open than spending two times more time dragging.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7C6NbyWzN90" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Try to avoid proning/sitting still while reviving so that you can cancel the revive and run away faster. Exception to this is if you are hiding behind a small object like a half wall or a window.

**Rifleman**

The main role of the rifleman is ammunition. The ammo bag the rifleman carries has many uses such as: 

Providing ammunition to your squad leader (especially for a rally point). A good squad leader will constantly be rotating their rally point in order to keep it alive therefore you have to take initiative to re-arm them ASAP after they place the rally point.

Providing ammunition to a medic requiring bandages 

Providing ammunition to an LAT / HAT as they are fighting a vehicle. When an anti-tank kit is engaging a vehicle, riflemen must take initiative to push to the anti-tank player and provide ammo for another shot. 

Spamming grenades (using it as a pocket mortar - throw nade, rearm, throw nade, repeat). Great if you’re on dead-dead and can’t peek.

You need to be mindful of your ammo and make sure you ask your squad leader/use your best judgement to figure out if it's okay to give your last 50 ammo (rally point). This is especially important for games where you know you won’t be having access to spawning on an ammo crate or vehicle. 
![](/docs/kits2.PNG)
Besides providing ammunition (which you must remember to rearm at all times when near a friendly vehicle or FOB ammo crate), the rifleman’s other main task is to shoot at enemy infantry and ends up being the one with the most time to LMB at the enemies. 

**Light anti-tank**

The main role of the LAT is to disable vehicles. There are some guides out there on where to hit vehicles in order to engine them or track them with one shot. When paired with a friendly vehicle, rifleman or ammo crate where the LAT can rearm easily, killing an enemy vehicle is achievable. When the vehicle is disabled, it is important to call it out to the team so that a friendly vehicle, a HAT/other LAT, commander ability or mortar can finish the kill. 

A secondary role of the LAT when there is no risk of enemy armor attacking the squad is to shoot rockets at enemy infantry who are hiding or in clusters. When there is an abundance of ammo, the LAT can “rocket spam” meaning shooting rockets and rearming over and over. 

It is the responsibility of all squad mates to swap to the LAT kit if it is open and there is an enemy vehicle causing problems in the area. Anyone can do this, even the squad leader.

**Grenadier (GL)**

The main role of the grenadier is to shoot explosives at infantry. This is especially useful when there are clusters of infantry or the infantry is hiding in buildings / behind cover. 

The smoke grenades can be used in numerous useful ways such as blocking chokepoints, revives, screening vehicles, screening machine gunners, screening towers. The grenadier smoke seems to be way stronger than handheld smoke grenades. 

**Machine Gunner / Scope AR**

The main role of the MG is to overwatch the squad and hold longer lanes. 

A good MG will be patient in order to consistently maintain his ground.

A good MG will have to know how and where to bipod quickly in order to not overexpose for too long. By reading the map, the MG will rotate and find lanes to cut enemies off / protect their squad.

Usually need good game sense to play this role properly in order to choose what lanes to hold and when/how to rotate.

### Squad Leader (very briefly)
Squad leaders are super important for winning the game. Not only do they place crucial spawn points (rallies & FOBs),but they also have communications with the other squads; extra information that can aid them in calculating the squad’s next move. Squad leading could be a huge guide of its own so I tried to regroup some of the most important fundamentals that have the biggest impact on the game. 

Make sure everyone is playing for the same goal. You generally want to avoid players just doing their own thing away from your squad’s goal (for main infantry, except if they are filling a special function). Every individual will have a different playstyle, and the squad will need to make sure all these are put together for the same goal. The goal could be executing a HAB take, defending a flag, capturing a flag, etc. Using an example of attacking an enemy hab, below are some examples of what players could be doing to contribute to this common goal (in order of aggressivity):
* **Finding gaps and shoving:** Utilising good game sense, this player found an area that is not covered by the opponent and punished the enemy for this open ground by shoving ahead of the squad. Usually, this shover will be the first one on the HAB. Inexperienced teams often play heavy on the flanks; the gaps could often be found in the wide-open centre or along the lattice lines. The player who aggressively finds gaps and shoves is usually very confident. Once on the HAB (and it is blocked by other friendlies that have caught up), this player will remain the tip of the spear by continuing the push to buffer out and stomp backup rallies / returning enemies from different angles. 
![](/docs/SL1.PNG)
*These 3 players could be in the process of finding/abusing a gap in the enemy (orange lines)*
* **Poking holes:** This player found an area that was covered by enemies, and killed them. By doing this, they are poking holes in the defence of the enemy. By using good game sense, the player can then decide whether or not to shove through this potential gap (utilising aforementioned notions of tempo and momentum) to get onto the HAB / past it.

* **Crossfiring/overwatch:** This player is often playing in a separate lane and covering your squad from there (crossfire) or he is sitting from afar and covering (overwatch). I feel like the best kit to accomplish this is the machine gunner or an optic player that has a more methodical playstyle. In this situation, at the start of the HAB take, this player could be farming the HAB from afar. Once his squad is on the HAB, this player would be sitting on a hill overlooking the HAB and areas enemies could run back from to retake the HAB. This player adapts a more analytical & methodical playstyle.

*By looking south, the player circled in green could be overlooking his squad from another lane*
* **Anchoring:** Once on the objective, this player will usually sit on it and hold a more passive angle. They could be the one shovelling the HAB and moving to re-frag / gain ground off the players that were more aggressive. When utilising two medics, the best player for this kit is the scope medic (when he dies he is a quicker/easier revive for the other medic). This player adapts a more methodical playstyle. 
* **Lurking:** This player will purposefully ignore enemies and disengage (will call them out of course) in order to sneak by with the intention of getting behind the enemy and stomping the rally point/getting info. Afterwards they can abuse a gap and keep pushing or wrap back towards the rear of the enemies to help the rest of the squad get through. 
* **Pocket medic:** This player is closely prioritising key players as a medic; acting as a skill amplifier by making sure the player that is being pocketed is constantly alive and in full health. A very important part of the squad, this player is usually playing the ironsight medic and has to adopt a very passive playstyle (see medic section about being the last one to die). The only times they will have to use their weapon is to refrag in short-mid range combat.

* Et cetera

The squad leader ensures to minimise travel time between tasks/objectives. You can do this by using a vehicle to travel (APC, heli pickup, etc.). 

The squad leader’s number one priority is to constantly have a rally point online. When placing a rally, you want it to be up for the whole game (a good rally) by using the fundamental ideas mentioned in the spawns section. Don’t be afraid to put it further, usually the benefits of a close rally is not worth the cons of running for an extra minute by placing the rally point 300 meters further. 

When the rally is placed, you must always have a rally point in your inventory. Always make sure to rearm off your vehicle or rifleman after placing the rally point so that you don’t get caught with no ammo later in the game when your riflemen are dead and your vehicle is nowhere to be found. Always be moving to place a better rally for your objective (situational, your rally could be left behind as an anchor or sensor). When flanking to have a better rally, move with a 2nd guy (usually a medic) while your squad draws fire. The rally can also be rotated by using a small armoured piece such as a TIGR or MRAP. By doing this, you could suddenly have your full squad spawning behind the enemy and induce panic. 

Abuse rally scanning. When your rally is placed and you have another one in your inventory, you can use it to determine if there are enemies within 50 meters. The first thing the game checks for when placing a rally is if there are enemies, and if there are none, a timer will not be applied. You can keep using your rally point (make sure there is no one around you or it will accidentally place a rally) as a scanner to see if there are enemies nearby. A timer will be applied if there are hostiles in the vicinity. If you do not predict needing another rally and don’t care for the risk of getting placed on a placement timer, there is no reason not to abuse rally scanning to get an idea of where the enemies are. This technique is especially useful for foliage maps where people are just proning and waiting for you.

*Demonstration of rally scanning*

When fighting with your rally as the primary spawn, ensure that your squad is spawning in sync (makes it easier to fight for the same goal when everyone is spawning together). 

Pay attention to the big picture (everyone’s job but specifically squad leader). Mention suspected gaps and timings. If players are not taking initiative to do certain tasks (such as abusing gaps, etc.) you will have to micromanage. Watch how the other squads are moving.

Ensure you are not tunnel-visioned on your objective. You can do this by paying attention to the other lanes around you and crossfiring (hope that they do the same for you or sending one of your own players to go crossfire on their behalf.

This is another thing that is everyone’s responsibility but often you will have to micromanage it as a good squad leader: coordinating explosives. Hard to reach areas can be hit by explosives such as mortar, vehicle, GL, LAT. If you kill someone in a building, they will probably be reviving and you can get the dead-dead with explosives. 

### Squad Composition
You must be wondering why the medic section above is so long and detailed… that is because other than the squad leader, medics are the most important kit of the squad for main infantry. The skill of your medics and the ability of friendlies to die in good spots make or break the squad. Quite simply and obviously, the medic is there to revive and heal people. However, you can definitely spot the differences when you are playing with a bad medic as the squad will constantly be getting wiped or giving up to respawn on rally since the medic is off doing his own thing or dead. This results in a loss of ground, slower attacks, and loss of tickets.

Several factors are taken into account when figuring out what kits to use in a squad (map, match size, etc), but there are some rules of thumb to follow. Often, it is up to the player to take initiative to choose what role to play in order to help the squad. Keep in mind these are for main infantry squads.
* You usually want at least one rifleman in the squad (for ammo bag)
* If the squad has four or more players, you need two medics. Running two medics increases the odds of getting revives (speedier revives + getting people out of dead-dead + giving stamina). The scope medic often plays a bit more aggressively while the ironsight medic hangs back and has priority for getting the revives. The ironsight medic should only be using his gun to re-frag therefore the scope isn’t really required (usually a CQB situation). A squad with two medics will usually burn fewer tickets as they will give up less.
* Consider using two LATs for the rollout if you are going in an area with likely enemy vehicles (switch off ironsight LAT later)
* Consider employing an MG for long lanes, squads that will be holding.

### Playstyle Spectrum
![](/docs/spectrum.PNG)
Above, I attempted to explain how players can contribute to the common goal of the squad. It is important to not mix up those jobs with squad playstyles. Playstyle is the inherent way someone likes to play. People tend to mislabel playstyle as “rats” vs “chads” or “dumb sprinters” vs “pussy proners”. From my experience playing with a lot of different people and playstyles, squad playstyles can be separated into two extremes - aggressive players and methodical players. 

Good aggressive players like to quickly poke holes and shove through the enemy as fast as they can. They are often the first players to reach the objective and usually get a lot of kills by making the enemy panic with their speed. The downside of this style is that they will often die a lot. If not playing with like-minded aggressive players, they will often die in un-revivable positions and constantly give up. This playstyle is more inconsistent than methodical but is critical to making sick plays that win games. Think squad version of the Counterstrike entry-fragger and maybe even combine the lurker.

Good methodical players like to remain in complete control of the situation (this is not to be confused with “passive”). They will usually be supporting the team by providing crossfire, anchoring, overwatch, and refrags. Being methodical does not mean they do not push or that they are slow. A good methodical player will still be poking and abusing gaps at the right moments. They will often die in revivable positions and die less than an aggressive player, but will usually get onto objectives later after the aggressive players. 

In my opinion, the most versatile and strong squad players are those who can play both the methodical playstyle and the aggressive style. They know when to use one style over the other and can quickly flip the switch on how they are playing (in a matter of seconds), making them extremely unpredictable and deadly (I have no idea how they do it). Let’s call them hybrids. 

For inexperienced players, I recommend you find a style that attracts you the most / the one you are better at. Stick to it and perfect it before moving on to attempting the other style. The aggressive playstyle is extremely hard to get into for the mechanically disadvantaged and can be more punishing for someone starting off (leading into int feeding). The methodical playstyle is difficult to master as you need to have the game sense to know where to play from to not be as useful as an AFK person. 

On the topic of squad and team composition, I can not tell you what the best way to combine these playstyles in a team is. Is it better to have squads of only aggressive players followed by squads of only methodical players? Is it better to have squads with mixes of many playstyles? I think both are viable and combining these two ideologies is the strongest. For squad composition and team composition I would focus on cohesion and synergy at the player level before looking at playstyle. 

### Tempo & Momentum
Tempo is a term I learned back when I played Hearthstone and it has stuck in my head since then. In simple terms, it describes which way the momentum of the round is going, and the control the player/squad/team has over the round. When you enter a round of Squad, you are constantly and subconsciously using tempo albeit some players better than others. Your goal as a game-aware infantry player is to always keep the tempo on the side of your squad, and your team in order to win. 

During the rollout / opener of your squad round before your initial skirmish, the tempo is neutral. Neither team has map control yet and the tempo is close to even. As you kill enemies and they are in the downed state, they will be getting revived or resetting off a spawn… you are gaining tempo. If you die, you lose your tempo. Get it?

Now for an example from a common scenario found in a match on Chora AAS v2. You are on Chora AAS v2 Hemp Farm as the US during the first engagement of the game. The Russians have put a FOB in the “Saddam's Compound” (the cheese grater building west of Hemp Farm). You push through Hemp Farm killing two enemies, increasing your tempo. The more your tempo increases, the more confidence you achieve to motivate you to push across the street to the enemy HAB with your teammates (who were also killing enemies - SL could be the one monitoring tempo at the squad level). This quick gain of tempo at the start allows you to win the first engagement, stomp the enemy HAB and make them hard reset on the flag before. 

Apply this concrete scenario to most firefights you will encounter as an individual infantry player in Squad. You will often be fighting 0 to 3 enemies (applies for most situations, will obviously change with proximity to enemy spawn). Squads are usually very spread out so it is rare you will be fighting 1v8 (you also have your teammates to help you). The table below dissects common firefight scenarios where there are enemies present, and the tempo you could gain when your reaction is to push through. 

| Aggressive action taken                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Potential tempo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Kill no one and push ahead**<br>By far the riskiest option as you know there are enemies ahead but you take a calculated risk by pushing through the front line (abusing a gap). Consider this when you hear gunshots in front of you that aren’t directed at your general direction. This tells you the enemies are shooting at friendlies and are scoped in / distracted meaning it could be possible to push past them and abuse a gap to find a spawn or shoot them in the back.<br><br>It’s a feeling thing and one of the hardest parts of lurking or aggressive playstyles.<br><br>Note: You must be decisive when pulling this off, if you are not gaining ground you MUST peek and help your allies that are getting shot at (especially when you aren’t getting shot at).  | You gain free tempo by abusing the gap and gaining ground, becoming undetected behind enemy lines. The possibilities are endless now: locate HABS, stomp rallies, shoot enemies in the back, etc.<br><br><br><br>Remember to be decisive and always play for the common goal of your squad.                                                                                                                               |
| **Kill one player and push ahead**<br>You see a player ahead and he is very close to you and you are fighting him. You win the fight and kill him (poking holes). You decide to assume he has no buddies around him and you push through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | After pulling off this move and deciding to push off of it, you need to decide if you slightly flank around the body or push straight through (depending on opponent style, map, etc.).<br>When poking holes you gain tempo (usually not as much as abusing a free gap), if the enemies don’t refrag you after the kill (lose track of you), they will know you made it past them and will likely chase you.  |
| **Kill two+ players and push ahead**<br>You fight a couple people, you kill all of them. You decide to push through off of it (creating huge gaps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | This is the most amount of tempo you can gain for your team as an infantry player in a firefight (other than stomping rallies or killing radios). Killing a lot of people is an instant tempo gain and a lot of the time, this specific situation is what gets you the flag or the fob take.                                                                                                                  |

### Friendly Spawn Game Sense
Spawns are extremely important in Squad, therefore it is important to know how to play with them. When mentioning spawns, I am talking about HABs and rally points. These are top priorities to properly attack/defend and move around the map; failure to play properly with your spawns will result in resetting from main or being stuck on the spawn screen. If main is being camped and you have no spawns, you could get rolled by the enemy team. Below are some pointers/tidbits of information for when you are playing off of a spawn point in Squad:

**General (Rallypoint and HAB)**

* Avoid shooting off of spawn if the opponent does not see you (especially off a rally point)
* For the first couple of spawns (when undiscovered) do not push in a straight line off the spawn point; this will make it extremely easy for the opponent to detect the spawn. 
* Don’t tunnel vision your objective/task. Once spawned, get in the habit of doing a quick 360 and paying attention to what is around the spawn. A lot of people are on autopilot when spawning and fail to realise there is a combat engineer on the HAB/FOB. 

**Rallypoint**

* The rally point can only be placed if there are no enemies within 50 m 
* The rally point is automatically stomped when enemies come within 30 m. Thus, ensure the rally point is not placed within 30 m of a road (to avoid stomp by vehicle) or common areas where enemies will push through.
* Ensure rallypoint is not placed in the open. A rally that can be spotted visually by the enemy is a bad rally. There will always be a bush/hut/etc to place your rally to reduce the odds of the enemy visually spotting it. Literally no reason to ever put a rally outside of concealment.
* Do not leave a vehicle on your rallypoint, inexperienced squads will leave the vehicle on the rallypoint (this is an extremely common mistake and makes it super easy to stomp rallies). Get in the habit of moving the vehicle off your rally, even if it is 50m away (aim for hiding the vehicle too) it will give you much better odds of preserving the rally.

* Constantly check your map for the rally stomp (it is everyone’s job)
* `DO NOT SHOOT OFF OF RALLY POINT.` With the small stomp radius, enemies can often run past it without stomping it (if they don’t catch you shooting off of it or running off of it)

**HAB**
* Do not leave a vehicle on your radio (same point as rally point)
* If your HAB is blocked and there are no friendlies in the vicinity to help you from outside, you must fight to unblock it as soon as possible (valid for most situations). The longer you wait, the more enemies that will stack up and the harder it will be to unblock it. 
* When possible, ensure HAB/Radio is not outside (mortars)
