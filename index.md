## Foreword
This is by no means an exhaustive Squad guide, merely a compendium of general game sense tips directed to an inexperienced Squad infantry player wanting to improve. I tried to keep it as brief and general as possible (I seem to have failed). Most of the information on here was gathered through my personal experience and close observation of some good Squad players over the years. For the experienced players choosing to read through this, I hope some of the arguments and statements in here make you reflect about the game; I would love to hear about the different aspects of the guide you agree/disagree with, and if you persuade me I will definitely update the information into the guide. 

My **personal opinions** are peppered all over the document, I am not telling you that this is the only way to play the game. The tips and arguments presented in this guide are what has worked for me and other players I have played with, and it could be possible that they don’t work for you. As per the OWI Code of Conduct, “there is no wrong way to play the game, there are only effective and ineffective tactics”, therefore take this guide as a suggestion!

Special thanks to Ol’ Jim (for helping provide and create clips) and various other members of the Squad community (notably Drizzle and Vex) for providing insights and second opinions on the contents of this document. 

Enjoy!

### Settings
**FOV:** For squad, I have found lower FOV (90-95) works best to have a bigger image of long-range targets. I use 90 FOV.

**Sensitivity:** Pretty standard concept for all FPS games, I reccomend to have a glance at [Juho's Guide for Accurate Shooting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CeQZ4v-V9R8sZ7NdtiMf17x7_IM3kr_C28bkmuMvZLc/edit) and generic FPS sensitivity videos. 

**Graphic settings:** Although a lot about graphic settings are personal preference, I have found the following settings to give me the best results in-game (as of v3.0). These are ethical settings and I recommend them to anyone with enough decency not to use .ini tweaks. I found it easier to see through foliage on epic foliage compared to low. Muzzle flashes are easier to spot on epic particles when compared to low particles. Upping these settings seemed to have minimal effect on my FPS. Some people argue that high shadows + contact shadows off is better than low shadows but I prefer low shadows as they seem to impact my FPS less when shooting.

Additionally, look up your monitor on google for some calibration settings in order to have the best colours (can increase vibrance and sharpness through the monitor this way if you wish).
